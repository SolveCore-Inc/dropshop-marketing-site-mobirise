                <p class="mbr-section-text lead">For the greatest level of success with your proposal, and to ensure that you can pay the supplier confidently, it is best to ensure that you have an existing working relationship with the supplier that you are trying to engage with. This existing relationship can mean having placed single orders with them previously in a drop-shipping manner, or having placed successful test orders with them in the past. This is a mutual step, as the supplier needs to be able to trust you, as much as you need to be able to trust them.<br><br><strong>Supplier sources</strong><br><br>You can find suppliers on sites like AliExpress, Ebay, or even Etsy. You can really find suppliers everywhere in any marketplace, however, we would recommend AliExpress to start, as it is most compatible with other single-order dropshipping apps. It will also let you build a relationship with your suppliers with the safety net that AliExpress’s customer service and refund policy extends to its customers.<br></p>

Once you have an existing relationship with a supplier, you can begin to reach out to them via email about starting to use bulk orders to place your orders. The challenge at this stage is often there can be a language barrier between suppliers and store owners. <br><br><strong>Be patient and persistent. </strong>Remember, the marketplace is big. If a supplier is unwilling to switch to bulk orders, you can always switch to a supplier that is willing. In the long term, it WILL pay off in time savings and personnel cost savings.<br>We remember times when our virtual assistants were staring down at pages and pages of single AliExpress orders (managed with another single order app system). After some minor negotiations, these dozens of pages turned in to one page as we were able to convert our best sellers to a bulk ordering arrangement.<br><br>There are really many ways that this can go. But, a good starting point is to get your suppliers email and reach out to them with a message like the following:<br></p>

They will usually send you details in the body of an email, or an a spreadsheet attachment.<br><br><strong>Bulk discounts</strong><br><br>Normally suppliers will offer you the same prices of their listing within AliExpress/Ebay/Etsy, but occasionally they will offer special bulk discounts (10%, 15%, or even buy X get Y free deals) depending on your order volume. It is up to you to negotiate to see what you can get. Don't be afraid to apply pressure about switching suppliers.<br><br><strong>Convince an existing bulk order supplier to pick up more products</strong><br><br>Suppliers that you have healthy existing relationships with, that you are already have engaged in the bulk ordering process with, will be open to getting additional products that you are willing to sell. Suppliers will usually only add products to their catalog that are similar in type or style (for instance if your supplier sells jewelry they are more likely to also pick up a new piece of jewelry you have found). <br><br>Just send them reference to an Ebay or AliExpress listing, and ask them if the will pick up the product so that you can start selling it.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-section-text lead">For those of you who are just starting out with bulk ordering, and for those who have been doing it for years, we have been participating in the same forums and Facebook dropshipping groups as you (like Kingpinning, Shopify Entrepreneurs, or Shopify Strategy, etc.) and have listened to those who have been in our shoes. We have been there for the countless questions about how shop owners were exporting CSVs, or the inquiries into how owners import tracking information back into Shopify. Comments surrounding these topics always point to disparate sources and multiple apps, but never to a comprehensive solution that does everything that you need <em>and</em> takes the work out of managing this process as part of a store's team. <br></p>

                <p class="mbr-section-text lead">So we went sat down and created DropShop–first for our own stores, then quickly realizing that we could help others by offering it to the public, we engineered a solution for the Shopify app store.<br><br>Our solution works well in parallel with single order systems like Oberlo or Shopified. We would recommend keeping your small one off items in your single-order system of choice, and transferring your winners to CSV/bulk order fulfillment as soon as possible. This has the benefit of lowering (or even making your monthly subscription to these single-order systems free, as well as letting you use them for quick product importing from AliExpress, while saving you countless hours (and dollars) by processing your winning items quickly and efficiently by ordering <strong>IN BULK</strong> with DropShop!<br><br>DropShop is an embedded app built to look and feel like part of Shopify–minimizing the learning curve and startup time. It enables you to easily manage the suppliers that you have bulk-ordering relationships with, and gives you the information that you need to grow these relationships.<br><br>DropShop lets you export custom files in .xls, .xlsx, and .csv format with the fields that matter most to you and your suppliers. DropShop lets you import tracking information in bulk, and also lets you track your order expenses. We have also paid special attention to how your tracking information appears from a customer standpoint by creating a way for you to map mail carriers (and carrier tracking services) to countries of destination–this enables you to provide accurate tracking to your customers and boosts their sense of trust.<br></p>
